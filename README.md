# SCREAM-analysis

## Intro

This is where to find all analysis for SCREAM in the DYAMOND 2 simulation. This includes all DYAMOND models not just SCREAM, but we are using this intercomparison to put SCREAM in context with the other DYAMOND models. Once we have established how SCREAM simulates clouds in DYAMOND, we will use SCREAM to test other hypothesis and work in a Variable-Resolution General-Circulation Model. 

## Key Points

1. The dyamond models produce a wide array of behaviors with respect to cirrus, convection, and TTL properties.
2. SCREAM performs adequately well in all aspects - we identify its biases compared to other models and to climatology
3. The complexity of the model microphysics does (not) correlate with accuracy of cirrus representation in the models

## Collaborators

All code is written by me, Sami Turbeville, with an assist from Jacqueline Nugent for some analysis.
